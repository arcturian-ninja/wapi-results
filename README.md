# WapiResults 

TASK
1) A school sent the data in the data.json file to a parent. The parent couldnâ€™t quite understand how to interpret the data. Using either Angular or AngularJS, graphs, tables and any other UI elements, create a page (plus any other pages as you may see fit) that will present the data in the most intuitive way, making it easier for the parent to understand it. Let your solution show your creativity.
